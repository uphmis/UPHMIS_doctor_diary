To be fixed:
- update events from API if no reports are in the queue.
	- so the reports are up to date.
- Color in calendar (buggy and ugly atm).
- UI fixes. At least regarding the calendar.
- There might be a bug, giving submitted reports a approval status by default. Needs looking into.
- Might not be possible to make changes to rejected reports older than 7 days, this needs to be checked.
- Encryption of password/authorization
